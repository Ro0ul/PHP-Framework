# üêò A Really bad PHP Framework
## A Fully Insecure And Unusable Full Stack PHP Framework Made To Fill Up My Github

This Project Is For my 3 Months Anniversery With PHP , And It Accomplished nearly nothing...
It's just a Full Stack "Framework" That Gives the worst UX Ever in human History

### The Features
+ CLI Tool ( not the best )
+ Migration
+ Router
+ Templating Engine ( Smarty )

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING Do not use this Framework For Production Based Purposes.


### List Of Command Lines

+ php log server : Starts The App 
+ php make:migrattion 'migrationName' : Creates A Migration
+ php make:model 'ModelName' : Creates A Model
+ php migrate 'migrationName' : Set up a previously Made Migration To Be Executed

- And it only works on linux
